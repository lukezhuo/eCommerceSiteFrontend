# eCommerceSite
Frontend for My First eCommerce site project (Version 1.0) using Vue.js, Flask, and SQLite. <br />
Since then, I have created Version 2.0 using Django, React, and SQL, shown at https://youtu.be/4g4KoMlEKfE. <br />
This was followed by Version 3.0 using NextJS and MongoDB, currently deployed at https://wish-shop.vercel.app/.
