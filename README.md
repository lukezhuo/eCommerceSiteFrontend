# eCommerceSite
Frontend for My First eCommerce site project (Version 1.0) using Vue.js, Flask, and SQLite. <br />
Since then, I have created Version 2.0 using Django, React, and SQL, which is showcased at https://youtu.be/4g4KoMlEKfE, <br />
followed by Version 3.0 built with NextJS and MongoDB, which is currently live deployed https://wish-shop.vercel.app/.
